"""
HalluciGuard - Canonical Judge Agent
The Chief Decision Officer of HalluciGuard.

The Judge receives VerifierResult from the Verifier and decides what the system should do next:
  - ACCEPT: Release draft response verbatim
  - CORRECT: Deliver targeted CorrectionRequest payload to Snehith's Corrector Agent
  - VERIFY_AGAIN: Request expanded verification pass (if retries available)
  - REJECT: Block response due to critical safety/contradiction risk
  - ABSTAIN: Insufficient evidence or unresolvable pipeline degradation

The Judge does NOT perform independent fact-checking, NLI model inference, or keyword refutation checks.
It relies on the authoritative factual investigation produced by the Verifier.
